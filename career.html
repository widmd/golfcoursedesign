        <h2>Projected Career Path</h2>
        <p>I aspire to become a **Director of Hospitality and Events** for a major championship-level golf course (e.g., a TPC or resort facility), leading the guest experience and revenue generation teams.</p>

        <h2>Individual Experience</h2>
        <p>During my internship at the *Pine Bluff Country Club*, I managed logistics for two major regional tournaments, resulting in a **15% increase** in non-member related food and beverage revenue for those events. I also implemented a new member communication platform.</p>

        <h2>Anticipated Contributions</h2>
        <p>I will introduce data-driven marketing strategies to the golf hospitality sector, utilizing customer relationship management (CRM) tools to personalize the luxury golf experience, thereby increasing member retention and driving high-value event bookings globally.</p>
